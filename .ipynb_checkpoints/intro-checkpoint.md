## Learning objectives
- Understand the basic structure of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) as a software
- Learn the four steps to set up and run a preindustrial control simulation
- Learn to use Python/Jupyter Nobebooks to analyze and visualize model output
- _Optional_
  - Learn how to configure and run CESM for paleoclimate (e.g., a mid-Holocene simulation)
  - Explore how CESM simulations can be used for hypothesis testing

---
## Quick Demos
- Basic introduction to Unix/Linux commands
- Introduction to Python and Jupyter Notebooks
- Overview of NSF NCAR computing resources and user access

---
## Morning modules
- Introduction to CESM: structure, components, and workflow
- Live demonstration: how to configure, build, and submit a CESM run

---
## Afternoon modules
- Hands-on exercises: analyzing CESM output on NCAR’s JupyterHub
- Option 1: Run and compare a pair of piControl and mid-Holocene simulations
- Option 2: Analyze ITCZ and monsoon dynamics using a long mid-Holocene simulation
- Additional resources: accessing model output and data analysis tips
- Challenging: Configure and run a Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) simulation
